# awful-discord-bot
you can send messages with it

# how to use
just like, make a .env file with your token called TOKEN

as in 
TOKEN=your_token_here
it isnt that hard

then run the py (make sure you have all the libraries installed) and give it the channel id and stuff
it will send a lot of error messages, if it covers your half-typed message dont worry the first half is still there just power through bro
